Conducted an exploratory data analysis of FitBit data collected at Amazon Mechanical Turk to explore and identify opportunities for growth for the company Bellabeat. The complete project with the analysis and recommendations can be found 
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/prashanthyadamala/bellabeat-casestudy-using-sql-and-r">here</a> on Kaggle. Over 1400 days of Fitbit data was used for the project by first merging, transforming and cleaning data using Excel and SQL to ensure 
data integrity using the ROCCC system. R Studio was then used to explore and visualize the data. The libraries used were ggplot, dplyr, lubridate and tidyverse. From the exploration, it was found that one of the best ways to identify growth was 
to analyse the customers that were using the products. Thus, the customers were segmented based on average daily steps (daily activity) and average daily device usage to understand the current customer base and opportunities to tailor future 
marketing campaigns to attract more customers.
