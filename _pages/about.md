As a dedicated and detail-oriented Data Analyst, I am passionate about using the power of data to help solve problems faced by people and businesses. Proficient in Power BI, SQL, Excel, Python and R, I thrive in converting complex raw data to simple yet informative visuals and actionable recommendations to assist in the decision-making process. 

With strong communication skills, I work closely with stakeholders to define the problem. With a focus on the issue, I analyse relevant data to present a strong data-driven narrative using Power BI's reports that provide meaningful insights. 

I look forward to connecting with you to explore the world of data and helping people solve problems.

Why data analysis? 
======
Analysis based on data is the closest thing that we have that can have the ‘truth’ mark stamped onto it. In a world where misinformation is rampant, information backed up by clean data is extremely important to making good decisions. I want to be able to use data to tell stories based on truth to help society and companies to move humanity forward. 


How I got into Data Analytics
======
I feel that my love for data was always preset. Whenever my friends or peers have made ridiculous claims, I am that guy in the corner asking, “So where is the data that backs it up?” 

In my Master’s degree when studying to be a manufacturing engineer at UNSW Sydney, I was dealing with a large set of data (not just a few points or a graph) to find which of two components was more reliable and cost-effective. I visualised the data using different graphs and charts to finally come to a conclusion on which was the better part.

Once I was done with the project, I realized that there was no way I would have come to a reliable solution if I had to sift through all that data without the help of these data analysis tools. This got my interest peeked. I then went on to work with the PVCESE department at UNSW to find data-driven solutions to raise the visibility of the “Educational Technology support options” provided.

When I completed my master’s degree I started to naturally look for work in my field. It was a couple of years later when I started the “Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate” on Coursera as I love learning new things and I had splurged on the annual plan so had to do something with it. I was immediately hooked! The course was a great introduction to the world of data analytics, the data analyst’s way of thinking, and the vast number of tools that can help you along with my first project. 

I immediately followed this up by learning Microsoft’s Power BI and fell in love with its functionality and intuitiveness. I went on to take the Microsoft PL-300 exam to become a “Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate.” So, here I am now, working with data that I find interesting and solving real-world problems. You can have a look at some of these projects in my portfolio tab.

Interests
======
In my free time, you might catch me reading getting lost in a science-fiction or fantasy novel. Being a guy from the countryside, I enjoy (maybe enjoyed, need to get back into it) going for jogs and taking in the nature around me. Listening to music and playing a little bit of guitar (I'm not the best at it) is something that I enjoy. 

In the future, I would love to learn how to surf well and glide on the waves of the Australian beaches. I was hooked after I went for my first few lessons. To feel the chaos and power under your feet with the refreshing sea breeze blasting in your face.
